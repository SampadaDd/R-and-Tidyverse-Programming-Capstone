# R-and-Tidyverse-Programming-Capstone
Introduction to Coursera Capstone Project completed

The Coursera Capstone Project, part of the Expressway to Data Science: R Programming and Tidyverse specialization, offers a unique opportunity to apply R programming and tidyverse skills to real-world data. 
Through the analysis of publicly available COVID-19 datasets, participants reinforce their data science knowledge while exploring the pandemic's impact on public health.
This project involves importing, cleaning, tidying, and merging datasets, followed by visualization and analysis to uncover meaningful insights. 
Participants work with datasets from the New York Times and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, using tools like ggplot2 for visualization and dplyr for data manipulation.
The capstone challenges students to draw actionable interpretations from their results and present them effectively. By the end of the course, we will be able to develop a comprehensive report showcasing their ability to handle real-world datasets and communicate insights. 
This report serves as a foundational piece for building a data science portfolio, marking an essential step in their journey into data science.
The Project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 through data-driven insights using publicly available data sets from reputable sources like The New York Times (NYT) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. 
The project integrates key stages of data analysis, including data collection, preparation, modeling, and visualization, to uncover trends and generate insights at national, state, county, and global levels. 
This comprehensive project bridges theoretical knowledge and real-world application by employing advanced analytical techniques to address critical questions about the pandemic's impact on public health.
